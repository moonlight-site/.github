# 🌙 Moonlight — Coming 2026

**A new way to play, connect, and explore the web.**  
Moonlight is being built to be your chill spot on the internet — smooth, private, and fun.

Not launched yet. Stay patient. It’s gonna be worth it.

### ✨ About Moonlight

Moonlight is a web platform built for 2026 and beyond — a place where you’ll be able to:

- Play games together
- Use built-in proxy browsing
- Chat and connect with friends
- And a lot more that we’re not announcing yet ;)

We're keeping things low-key for now while we build, test, and make sure everything feels right.

### 🕶️ Why We're Creating Moonlight

The internet should feel *free*, not restricted.  
Moonlight is about:
- Smooth experience  
- Clean design  
- Privacy first  
- No stress, no clutter  

Just vibes.
